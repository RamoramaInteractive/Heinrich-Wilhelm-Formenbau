## Introduction
The mold register is a software I'm developing for the company [Heinrich Wilhelm Gummi- und Plastic KG](https://wilhelm-kg.de/) with Python and the framework [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). I also designed the corresponding icons with Adobe Photoshop. At the moment only the GUI is finished and will be extended continuously.

## Purpose
The aim is to develop a software with database connection in which information about rubber molds can be stored. For these molds, drawings and graphics can also be uploaded in various formats. 

## Future

Internally, the software is already under further development and new adjustments and improvements are constantly being made to the software, the UI design and the database. Currently the GUI prototype serves as a portfolio. An advanced version of the software will be released as soon as I get permission from Heinrich Wilhelm Gummi- und Plastic KG.

## Notes

In order to start the GUI make sure you have installed the PyQt5 package.

`pip install PyQt5`
